681449737,negative,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."

681449744,negative,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.

681449752,positive,@united thanks. Just a program comment
681449754,negative,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns

681449761,negative,@united flight attendant doesn�۪t understand not understanding English doesn�۪t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
681449763,negative,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
681449765,negative,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
681449766,negative,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents _���
681449768,negative,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
681449770,positive,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.

681449777,positive,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."

681449784,negative,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
681449785,negative,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
681449787,negative,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
681449789,negative,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"

681449802,positive,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp
681449804,negative,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
681449805,negative,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
681449807,negative,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"

681449818,negative,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
681449819,negative,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
681449822,negative,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"

681449842,positive,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
681449844,negative,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
681449845,negative,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"

681450321,negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
681450322,negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united

681450325,negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
681450326,negative,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay

681450356,negative,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
681450357,negative,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
681450358,negative,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"

681450390,negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.

681450394,negative,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability

681454080,negative,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL

681454091,negative,@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp
681454092,negative,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"

681454107,negative,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
681454108,negative,@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
681454109,negative,@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
681454110,neutral,@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
681454111,negative,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"

681454114,negative,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
681454115,negative,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
681454116,negative,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
681454117,negative,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
681454118,neutral,@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids

681454149,negative,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
681454150,negative,@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United

681460392,negative,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening

681460429,negative,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... _��� what about the impossible connection that started this?
681460430,negative,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp
